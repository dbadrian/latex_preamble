%%% Hyphenation
% When the default language is english, LaTeX applies a weird hyphenation rules for words with a hyphen:
% It only split words at the hypen...
% In particular for long words such as ``dense-discretization'' this is not good
% With LuaLaTeX we can make exceptions and tell LaTeX where to split these words
% Does NOT work with pdfLaTeX
